<h2><a name="preface" id="preface"></a>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>This book is intended for use in all grades of elementary
schools, the method of presentation varying with the age of the
pupils. It has been welcomed even by pupils in higher schools,
because easily familiarizing them with myths and characters
that figure so largely in the literary texts with which they are
to deal.</p>

<p>In the first and second grades the teachers should read or tell
some of the stories to the pupils, thus satisfying the demand of
children for a story, and preparing the way for an appreciation
of literature. The pupils should retell the stories, thus enriching
their vocabulary and learning to express thought clearly,
easily, consecutively, and confidently,&mdash;a power so much needed
and so valuable to citizens of a republic.</p>

<p>Some of the poems, as &ldquo;Daybreak,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Moss Rose,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Forget-me-not,&rdquo; &ldquo;Sweet and Low,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Child&rsquo;s World,&rdquo; etc.,
should be memorized. If this work has been well done in these
grades, the pupils of third and fourth grades will enjoy reading
the stories, continuing the reciting of myth and poem. The
pictures that so well illustrate the myths should be studied and
described. In these classes and in the grammar grades the
stories should be written and the poems reproduced accurately,
serving as valuable lessons in form, in spelling, punctuation, and
capitalization. The reproduction of the myth and poem both
orally and in written papers is an exercise whose value cannot
be overestimated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>8]</a></span>
While the myths are valuable in themselves as stories which
appeal to and which nourish the imagination, and as aids to
expression in oral and written language, they are also very
helpful, when presented early, to the understanding of references
with which our literature is filled, and make the reading of
the best in literature more of a delight because of this knowledge.
It is important that these myths be given to children who enjoy
the world of fairy tale and myth,&mdash;children who in their imagination
drive the car of Apollo with the bold Pha&euml;thon, and see
with Narcissus the nymph smiling in the brook.</p>

<p>The poems and pictures in the book serve to illustrate the
debt both poets and artists owe to the fancies of the beauty-loving
Greeks, the children of our race. With imagination and
memory nourished and stored with stories that have been part
of men&rsquo;s literary possessions for centuries, and which have been
embodied in all the arts, the love for literature which is permanent
and valuable will leave no room for the worthless and
transitory.</p>

<h2><a name="the_seasons" id="the_seasons"></a>THE SEASONS.</h2>


<p>The earth receives light from the sun, and completes
its course through the heavens once a year. Each year
brings Spring with her garlands of flowers, Summer&mdash;golden
Summer&mdash;with her sheaves of sunlit grain,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>23]</a></span>
Autumn with the purple grape, and Winter clad in frost
and snow.</p>

<p>Every year there is the same order of the seasons.
Therefore man knows when to plant the tiny seeds,
when the harvests and fruits will ripen, and what provision
to make for the cold but merry winter.</p>

<p>Just as little children, tired with play, and men who
work all day, must have the night for sleep and rest,
so Mother Earth, who plays and works so gaily from
March to October, must have the winter season for rest.
Then she covers herself with a mantle of snow, and
sings a sleepy lullaby song.</p>

<p>Each of the seasons has three months to attend her.</p>

<p>Spring, clad in dainty green, has March with cleansing
winds, changeable April with sunshine and rain,
and tender May with the fragrant flowers.</p>

<p>Summer, in her golden dress, has June, July, and
August to attend her.</p>

<p>Autumn, with September, October, and November,
comes with her hands filled with baskets of fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>26]</a></span>
Winter has December, January, and February to
cover the earth with snow, to freeze the rivers, and to
paint curious pictures upon the windowpanes.</p>

<p>Can you compare the passing of the year and the life
of man? Childhood, the springtime of life, is the time
for play and dance and merry song, the time to make
the body supple and strong. When the body is strong
and the mind has been trained, comes the summer time
of work&mdash;hard work in all the fields of labor, that the
harvest may not fail. In the autumn of life, when the
labor of the summer ripens into fruit, how pleasant
to reap the reward of work! Then slowly come the
snowy hair and the winter of life, when we sit by the
fire and tell the story of our battles, our struggles, our
defeats, and our victories.</p>

<p>Each season of the year has its pleasures and its
tasks, and so has each season of life. A youth of
cheerful labor and study brings its own reward of a
well-prepared and happy adult life. Then we can repeat
Browning&rsquo;s cheering words,&mdash;</p>

<p>The Greeks lived much in the open air, and dearly
loved the trees, the flowers, the birds, the sea and sky.</p>

<p>They watched the clouds floating in the beautiful
azure dome, sometimes in long lines like soldiers, sometimes
looking like great curly white feathers, and sometimes
piled high like mountains of snow.</p>

<p>They saw the sun rise, coloring the clouds and
awakening all things on the earth; and they watched
him sink in the western sky, flooding the heavens with
brilliant hues.</p>

<p>In the quiet night, they saw the lovely stars come,
one by one at first, and then in such numbers that
their eyes were dazzled, and they thought of God and
of the beauty of His works.</p>

The poets dreamed and sang about the spirits which
inhabited all the forms of nature. All the people loved
these fancies, and repeated the stories again and again.

<h2><a name="the_months_winter" id="the_months_winter"></a>THE MONTHS.&mdash;WINTER.</h2>


<p>In addition to its four seasons&mdash;spring, summer,
autumn, and winter&mdash;the year is divided into twelve
months. Long ago, there were but ten months, and
the first month was March. But when January and
February were added, the year had twelve months, and
January, the second month of the winter season, is now
called the first month of the year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Month&rdquo; and &ldquo;moon&rdquo; come from a word which
means &ldquo;to measure.&rdquo; It takes the earth three hundred
and sixty-five days, or a year, to revolve around the sun.
The moon revolves around the earth about twelve times
in one year; so the moon is the measurer of the year,
and the twelve periods we call months.</p>

<p>From Janus, a Roman god, comes the name of the
first month of the year. Janus is the two-headed god.
A temple of this divinity was placed at the city gate of
Rome. His statue had one face looking toward the city
and one beyond the gate. The month of January
stands at the gateway of the year, with one face looking
toward the past and one toward the future.</p>

<p>Our second month, February, receives its name from
a Latin word which means &ldquo;to purify,&rdquo; for in this month
the people used to purify their homes and offer sacrifices
to the gods, who love order and cleanliness.</p>

<h2><a name="the_months_spring" id="the_months_spring"></a>THE MONTHS.&mdash;SPRING.</h2>


<p>The name of the famous Mars, god of war, was given
to the first month of spring. This month, formerly the
first of the year, is now the third. Mars is fond of storm
and strife, and his name is very appropriate for this
windy, stormy month. In March the sun turns back
in his journey among the stars, and begins to come
north again. The days grow longer in our part of the
world, and we know that summer is coming.</p>

<p>In April the snows melt, the little brooks awake and
chatter over their pebbly beds, the birds return to gladden
us with their songs, and the tiny leaves peep out of
their winter nests. The earth seems to open to receive
the moist rains and the warm winds. April, the beautiful
name given to this second month of spring, comes
from a Latin word meaning &ldquo;to open.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lovely month of May is a great favorite with the
poets. Many of them have written charming poems in
her honor. Maia, in whose honor this month was
named, is the mother of Mercury, the winged messenger
of the gods. The Romans held this god in great honor,
and gave the name of his mother to the loveliest of the
months.</p>

<h2><a name="the_months_summer" id="the_months_summer"></a>THE MONTHS.&mdash;SUMMER.</h2>


<p>June, the month of roses, is named in honor of the
stately Juno, queen of the gods. Juno is the goddess
of happy marriages, and June is the favorite month
for weddings.</p>

<p>July is named in honor of Julius C&aelig;sar, the greatest
of the Romans in the art of war. In peace, also, he
advanced the condition of the people, and he was a
great statesman and writer. He it was who reformed
the calendar, and so it is just that his name should be
given to one of the months.</p>

<p>Octavius C&aelig;sar was the nephew and heir of Julius
C&aelig;sar, the great commander. After conquering his
enemies, he became the master of Rome and was named
Emperor by the Roman Senate. He ruled the empire
wisely and well, and received the title Augustus, which
means &ldquo;worthy of reverence.&rdquo; From him the eighth
month receives its name&mdash;August.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar Augustus was the friend of the poets and orators
who lived during his reign. So many beautiful
poems were written at that time, and all the arts so
flourished, that the reign of Augustus has been called
&ldquo;The Golden Age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The months of September, October, November, and
December are named from Latin words that mean
&ldquo;seven,&rdquo; &ldquo;eight,&rdquo; &ldquo;nine,&rdquo; and &ldquo;ten.&rdquo;</p>

<p>When the beginning of the year was placed in
March, these months were named from their position
the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth months. When
the first day of January was made the first day of the
year, these months became the ninth, tenth, eleventh,
and twelfth months, but their names were not changed.
December is, of course, the first month of winter.</p>

<p>Each year has three hundred and sixty-five days,
except leap year, which comes once in four years.
In leap years there are three hundred and sixty-six
days, the extra day being added to the month of February.</p>

young and smiling face. So we have made the first
day of January a holiday, that friends may wish one
another a &ldquo;Happy New Year.&rdquo;</p>

<p>February has many days that are dear to us. The
birthdays of our noble presidents, Lincoln and Washington,
are always celebrated with honor for their
greatness and rejoicings for our country&rsquo;s prosperity.
Longfellow and Lowell, two of our greatest poets,
are also remembered. St. Valentine&rsquo;s Day is a festival
welcome to children, and to all who love to see young
people gay and happy.</p>

<p>In March we have no holiday.</p>

<p>In many of our states a very interesting holiday has
been given to April. It is called &ldquo;Arbor Day,&rdquo; for on
this day trees are planted. Men have always felt a
reverence for trees, and have believed that</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;The groves were God&rsquo;s first temples.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Greeks gave a personality to trees, and the Druids
worshiped the strong and noble oak. So we are setting
aside a day when all the people shall make holiday,
and plant trees whose shade shall refresh and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>44]</a></span>
whose fruit shall nourish us. This is a beautiful holiday,
and one full of meaning. Our poet Bryant says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem21">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;What plant we in this apple tree?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sweets for a hundred flowery springs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To load the May wind&rsquo;s restless wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, from the orchard row, he pours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fragrance through our open doors;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A world of blossoms for the bee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flowers for the sick girl&rsquo;s silent room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the glad infant sprigs of bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We plant with the apple tree.&rdquo;<br /></span>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>May brings with her one of the most sacred and
beautiful days of all the year. On Memorial, or Decoration,
Day we cover with flowers the graves of those
who died to preserve the nation.</p>

<p>In England and in Sweden, May Day is given up to
dance and song and flower shows. This festival began
in honor of Odin, the old Norse god of the sun.</p>

<p>June has no day that is remembered as a universal
holiday. But in July we find the greatest day of the
year&mdash;the Fourth of July, Independence Day. Every
child knows that on this day our nation was born.
The flags, the drums, the trumpets, the cannon,&mdash;all
awaken in the breast of every American a thrill of love
and pride that will never pass away.</p>

<p>August is passed by; but on the first Monday in
September comes Labor Day. This has been

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>46]</a></span>
celebrated for only a few years, but the meaning of the
holiday lies deep in the minds and hearts of men who
realize that labor is man&rsquo;s greatest blessing and hope.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day, generally the last Thursday in
November, is sacred to the memory of our honored
ancestors, who bravely and nobly endured the cold
and want of that first New England winter, confident
that the God whom they trusted and served would
not forget them.</p>

<p>December has the children&rsquo;s great festal day,&mdash;the
blessed Christmas, when the lessons of Christ&rsquo;s life
blossom into deeds, and a loving spirit seems to spread
over all the land. The carols, the Christmas trees, the
merry bells, make the heart gay, and all the air resounds
with Christmas glee. We read the Christmas stories,
sing the old songs, send loving greetings to absent
friends, and rejoice with the happy children, for &ldquo;of
such is the kingdom of heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="the_days_of_the_week" id="the_days_of_the_week"></a>THE DAYS OF THE WEEK.</h2>


<p>In the southern countries of Europe, the days of the
week were named after the gods of the Greeks and
Romans. But in our country, and in some of the countries
of northern Europe, the gods of the North have
given their names to the days.</p>

<p>Sunday and Monday received their names from the
sun and the moon&mdash;the radiant lamps that light the
earth by day and by night.</p>

<p>Tiw is the god of honorable war, the son of Odin
and Frigga, the earth mother. His emblem is the
sword, and in olden days the people did him great
homage. Tuesday, the third day of the week, was
named in his honor.</p>

<p>Wednesday was called Woden&rsquo;s day, in honor of
Woden, or Odin, the king of the gods. He was often
called the All Father.</p>

<p>Thor, the son of Odin, is one of the twelve great
gods of northern mythology. &ldquo;Whenever he throws
his wonderful hammer,&rdquo; they used to say, &ldquo;the noise of
thunder is heard through the heavens. He is the only
god who cannot cross from earth to heaven upon the
rainbow, for he is so heavy and powerful that the gods
fear it will break under his weight.&rdquo; Thursday was
sacred to Thor.</p>

<h2><a name="ceres" id="ceres"></a>CERES.</h2>


<p>All through the warm days of July and August, the
grain ripens in the rays of the sun, and in September
the fields are yellow with nodding heads of golden grain.
Ceres, the earth mother, has been driving north and
south, east and west.</p>

<p>Two beautiful maidens always attend her,&mdash;Flora,
with garlands of roses, who cares for the lovely flowers,
and Pomona, who ripens the fruits for man to eat.</p>

<p>As Ceres passes, the fields and woods gleam with
color and beauty, and all the voices of nature join man&rsquo;s
in hymns of thanksgiving for her bounty. The old
Greeks tell us, that it is she who taught men how to
cultivate the fields; how to prepare the soil for the seed,
when to plant the many grains and fruits, and how to
care for the young and tender plants.</p>

<p>In autumn, after the work of spring and summer, she
rejoices in the bounteous harvests, in the vineyards filled
with purple grapes. Great golden pumpkins, like huge
apples, lie basking in Apollo&rsquo;s rays; the purple aster
and the golden-rod add color to the landscape. Ceres
is glad at heart. She is happy in the results of her labor
and in the presence of her lovely daughter, Persephone.
But when Persephone leaves her mother, Ceres is
sad, and winter, cold and drear, settles over the earth.</p>

<h2><a name="ceres_and_persephone" id="ceres_and_persephone"></a>CERES AND PERSEPHONE.</h2>


<p>You will wonder why Persephone is not always with
her mother. This is the story the Greeks tell.</p>

<p>As Ceres takes care of the ripening grains and fruits
all over the earth, it is necessary for her to visit every
country of the world. One day she was seated in her
chariot drawn by those wonderful winged dragons, ready
to set forth on her travels. She kissed her little daughter,
and warned her not to go far from home. She had
never before felt so anxious about leaving her little girl,
but she had to go.</p>

<p>Persephone threw a loving kiss to her fond mother,
and then went to the shore of the sea to play with the
sea nymphs. They are graceful, slender girls, with sea-green
hair and eyes like opals. They are charming
playmates, but cannot come out of the water. Persephone
gathered flowers for them, and was obedient to
her mother&rsquo;s command.</p>

<p>But Pluto, the god of the palaces of gold and silver
under the earth, looking out from one of the caverns,
saw the pretty child, and wanted to carry her away to
his home. So he caused a wonderful flower, all crimson
and gold, to charm Persephone farther away. She
stooped to pick it; and lo! it came up by the roots, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>56]</a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
deep cavern yawned, and the chariot of King Pluto
appeared.</p>

<p>The driver, who was King Pluto himself, caught the
frightened Persephone in his arms. Whipping his coal-black
steeds, he hurried away with her to his home in
Hades.</p>

<h2><a name="the_search_of_ceres" id="the_search_of_ceres"></a>THE SEARCH OF CERES.</h2>


<p>When Ceres returned and could not find her little
girl, she was frantic. Over the whole earth she drove
her chariot, calling upon all things to help her in her
search&mdash;but in vain!</p>

<p>Then she became so sad that she refused to allow the
earth to produce any food for man or beast. The
flowers and trees and harvests drooped and faded. In
vain did gods and men plead with her. She would not
be comforted.</p>

<p>At last Jupiter sent the swift-flying Mercury, messenger
of the gods, to Pluto, commanding him to release
Persephone. When Ceres saw her daughter restored
to her, what joy was hers! Yet she feared one thing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you eaten anything in Pluto&rsquo;s kingdom, my
child?&rdquo; was her anxious question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, dear mother,&rdquo; Persephone replied, &ldquo;six pomegranate
seeds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Alas! then you must remain with Pluto six months
of every year,&rdquo; said the sad Ceres.</p>

<p>Thus it is that for six months Ceres and Persephone
are together, the earth is covered with the blessed
gifts of Ceres, and it is summer over the land. But
when they are separated, the mother grieves, and winter
is king.</p>

<h2><a name="diana" id="diana"></a>DIANA.</h2>


<p>Diana, the goddess of the moon, is the twin sister of
Apollo. She completes her journey around the earth
once in a month. Her chariot is of polished silver, and
her horses are dark as night. She is a strong and
beautiful goddess, with a robe of deepest azure, and a
golden crescent in her black hair.</p>

<p>When Apollo sinks in the west, the chariot of Diana
appears, and she drives like a queen over the floor of
heaven, which is studded with twinkling stars. How
lovely is the night! Sometimes we see only a silver
crescent, and the rim of the moon. This the children
call the baby moon. But night after night the moon
shows more and more of her silver face, until she seems
like a great ball floating high in air. This we call the
full moon. The stars are her maidens, who welcome
her coming and attend her on her journey.</p>

<p>In September, the grains are gathered into the barns,
and we call the full moon in that month the Harvest
Moon.</p>

<p>The October full moon is the Hunter&rsquo;s Moon, for
in that month Diana leads the jolly hunters. Then,
according to the old Greeks, she leaves her chariot, sees
that her bow and arrows are ready, calls her maidens,
and steps forward, strong and free, to the chase.</p>

<h2><a name="the_pleiades" id="the_pleiades"></a>THE PLEIADES.</h2>


<p>Diana had seven graceful maidens who hunted the
deer with her. One day they saw Orion, a great
hunter, coming toward them with his dog and his big
club. Orion was a giant, and the maidens feared him
and ran away.</p>

<p>Orion called to them not to be afraid, for he wished
to hunt with them. But still they fled, and when they
were weary and saw that he was overtaking them, they
called upon the gods to save them from the mighty
hunter. The gods loved them, and listened to their
cries. When Orion thought he had at last caught up
with them, he saw, not the maidens, but seven snow-white
doves flying away under the azure sky.</p>

<p>At night, when the queenly Diana looked down from
her chariot, she saw that her attendants had been transformed
to doves. As she could not give them their
original form, she placed them in the heavens as stars
to attend her during the night.</p>

<h2><a name="aurora" id="aurora"></a>AURORA.</h2>


<p>Aurora, goddess of the dawn, is the young sister of
Diana, the queen of night. It is her duty to open the
eastern doors of the palace of the sun, and to strew
the path of Apollo, the sun god, with roses. Just before
sunrise she appears in the eastern sky, her rosy fingers
tinting the misty clouds.</p>

<p>Aurora is goddess of the evening light, as well as
of the dawn. Long after the chariot of the sun has
disappeared below the horizon, the western clouds
are bright with the rosy light of this beauty-loving
goddess.</p>

<p>In some countries the twilights are very long, and
Aurora seems to linger on the hilltops. She sprinkles
refreshing dew upon the thirsty flowers, who have
bravely raised their heads to the sun all day. They
revive under her gentle care.</p>

<p>At evening, when she is slowly closing the gates of
the west, the eyes of the little children grow tired of
day and close in welcome sleep. The birds, too, who
welcome the fair Aurora with their joyous matin songs,
now seek their nests, and their last chirp is heard as
the twilight deepens. Then Aurora bars the gates, gives
the lantern, or evening star, to Hesperus, and returns to
the east for her morning task.</p>

<p>Aurora loves the pretty flowers and often wanders

tender blossoms.</p>

<p>One morning she met the handsome youth, Tithonus.
Aurora loved Tithonus, and, as he was a mortal, she
begged the gods to give him immortal life. Unfortunately,
she forgot to ask for him immortal youth, and
after a while he began to grow old. Although he still
lived in her palace and fed on ambrosia, the food of the
gods, he became smaller and smaller, until Aurora was
ashamed of him and turned him into a grasshopper.</p>

<p>This is the way you see him to-day&mdash;with the face
of an old man on the body of a grasshopper.</p>

<p>Memnon was the son of Aurora and Tithonus, and
was dearly loved by his young and beautiful mother.
He became a very brave man. When the Trojan war
broke out, he came from the East to help the Trojans.
At first he was successful, and he put the Greeks to
flight; but when Achilles met him, a great struggle
began. Long they fought and bravely; but at last
Memnon fell.</p>

<p>Aurora, who had witnessed Memnon&rsquo;s defeat, told his
brothers, the Winds, to bear his body to his home in
the far East. There in the evening Aurora came to
weep over the body of her son. The Hours, the rosy
sister goddesses, joined in her grief, and the shining
Pleiades veiled their faces in sorrow.</p>

<p>Aurora still laments the untimely death of her son,
and her tears you may find in the early morning as dewdrops
upon the bending grass and flowers.</p>

<h2><a name="the_nymphs_and_other_goddesses" id="the_nymphs_and_other_goddesses"></a>THE NYMPHS AND OTHER GODDESSES.</h2>


<p>The Greeks, in their love for nature, believed that
all her forms had life and feeling. The mildness of
their climate, their out-of-door life, the apparent nearness
of sea and sky, the beauty of mountain, tree, flower,
and glistening rivulet, made nature dear to them. Their
love for the beautiful outside world was nourished, and
caused them to look upon all nature as friendly. Their
vivid fancy peopled grove and dale with forms that
returned human affection.</p>

<p>They liked to believe that every stream had a naiad
sporting in its waters, that dryads lived in the graceful
trees, and that shrubs and flowers were the outward
forms of spirits imprisoned there.</p>

<p>Oreads, or mountain nymphs, wandered over the
mountains, and their laughter echoed in the valleys.
Nereids and oceanids&mdash;water nymphs&mdash;sported in the
waves of the ocean, and, with the tritons, attended Neptune,
god of the deep blue sea.</p>

<p>The sunflower concealed the sea nymph Clytie, and
lovely Echo was transformed into a voice. The laurel
tree, with its glossy green leaves, was but the nymph
Daphne, to whom, when fleeing from Apollo, her father,
the river god, gave this form.</p>

so beautifully that all the sailors who passed that way
longed to see the singers, and, coming too near, were
wrecked on the rocks which the water concealed.</p>

<p>There were some nymphs and goddesses who were
always mentioned together. The Graces were three
maidens of charming appearance, who waited upon
Venus. No one was so beautiful that the Graces could
not add to her charm and loveliness, and they were ever
welcome guests in every home.</p>

<p>The Fates also numbered three. These severe goddesses
could reveal the future to men and gods and no
one could escape their decrees. Even Jupiter must
obey the Fates, daughters of stern necessity. The
decrees of the gods and the Fates were generally revealed
to men by priestesses called sibyls. These wise
women lived in caves. Their prophecies, or oracles, as
they were called, were believed in and greatly respected

<p>The Furies were deities who searched out all wicked
people and punished them for their crimes, pursuing
them with whips and snakes. The Furies were really
friends to man, because they wished him to repent of
his guilty deeds, live a better and truer life, and do good
and not evil in the world.</p>

<p>The nine Muses, those gracious daughters of Jupiter
and Memory, sang their songs and joined in a graceful
dance on Mount Parnassus. Apollo, god of poesy and
song, was their teacher, and from him they learned how
to inspire artists, poets, and musicians with thoughts of
harmonies more beautiful than ordinary mortals know.</p>

chariot through the heavens.</p>

<h2><a name="apollo_and_the_muses" id="apollo_and_the_muses"></a>APOLLO AND THE MUSES.</h2>


<p>When Apollo&rsquo;s daily task is done, he removes the
dazzling rays from his head and places there the wreath
of laurel which he much prefers. Then he goes to Parnassus,
the beautiful mountain in Greece, where the
Muses dwell. The Muses are nine maidens, the wonderful
daughters of Memory, to each of whom Apollo
has given some department of music or poetry. All
musicians and poets are said to ask Apollo and the
Muses for aid and inspiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>89]</a></span>
To Calliope, the muse of epic poetry, Homer and
Vergil prayed when they sang of war and heroes.</p>

<p>Astronomers appeal to Urania, who presides over
the stars&mdash;their song makes the music of the spheres;
and those who write history must be aided by Clio.</p>

<p>To Thalia and Melpomene are given the realms of
comic and tragic poetry.</p>

<p>Erato, who presides over the poems of love, generally
accompanies the youngest and gayest of the Muses,
Terpsichore. The chief pleasure and delight of Terpsichore
is in the graceful movements of the dance. When
Euterpe, the muse of lyric poetry, strikes her golden
lyre, these three, with their music, song, and dance,
create exquisite beauty and harmony, and they are much
beloved by their sister Muses and by mortals.</p>

<p>The wisest and most dignified of all the Muses is
Polyhymnia, who presides over sacred music. She it
is who inspires the hymns of praise to the Almighty
Ruler of the world.</p>

<p>Apollo instructs these maidens in the arts of poetry
and music, and then they unite in a merry dance; for
they are graceful beings and have strong, beautiful
bodies. The Greeks believed in the culture of the body,&mdash;the
temple of the soul,&mdash;and so Apollo, god of the
sun, of poetry and music, was also their ideal of physical
perfection.</p>

<h2><a name="apollo_and_daphne" id="apollo_and_daphne"></a>APOLLO AND DAPHNE.</h2>


<p>One day Apollo found Cupid, the mischievous little
god of love, playing with his arrows, and he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Why
are you playing with my arrows? You are only
a boy and should not use manly weapons!&rdquo; Cupid did
not like to be called a child, and took from his own
quiver two tiny arrows, one tipped with lead, one with
gold. The golden arrow he shot into the heart of Apollo;
the leaden, into the heart of a young and graceful wood
nymph, Daphne.</p>

<p>When Apollo saw Daphne, the golden arrow in his
heart made him love her, and he pursued her; but the
heavy arrow of dull lead in her heart made her dislike
him, and she fled.</p>

<p>Soon Daphne found that she could not run so fast
as Apollo, and she called upon her father, the river
god, to save her. He heard her cry and changed her
into a beautiful laurel tree. When Apollo came up
he saw that her body was growing rough with the bark,
her slender feet were changing into the roots, and her
long wavy hair was turning into the shiny green leaves.</p>

<p>The sun god grieved at this change, but said: &ldquo;This
tree shall be sacred to poets and musicians and artists.
I shall wear a wreath of laurel, and all who follow the
arts shall be crowned with the laurel wreath.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="clytie" id="clytie"></a>CLYTIE.</h2>


<p>Clytie was a beautiful sea nymph who lived in a
wonderful palace under the sea. Her dress was of pale
green sea moss, and she wore ornaments of delicate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>97]</a></span>
pink coral in her sunny curls. Her carriage was an
exquisite shell of many brilliant hues, which glittered
in the sunlight, and gold fish were her strange and
beautiful horses.</p>

<p>One day, when she was driving over the surface of
the sea, she saw the glorious god Apollo in his golden
chariot. Day after day she watched him journey through
the deep blue sky, and hoped he would see her. Alas!
he never noticed the lonely sea maid, so far below.</p>

<p>At last she left her chariot, and all day long watched
him from the shore. When the sun had gone and she
started to return to her home under the waves, she
could not move. Her feet had become fastened to the
soil and her form began to change into the sunflower.
Her green dress became the stalk and leaves, and her
golden hair changed into the yellow petals.</p>

<p>But the flower still loves the sun. In the morning it
looks toward the east and rejoices when the sun appears
above the horizon, following his course and slowly turning
its face toward the west.</p>

<p>So this flower is the emblem of constancy. Poets
often speak of the great love and faithfulness of Clytie,
and artists paint her picture or sculpture her form.</p>

<p>In the art galleries may be found a lovely bust of a
young girl. The sculptor is unknown, but the bust is
supposed to be one of Clytie, for the shoulders seem to
rise from the leaves of the sunflower.</p>

<h2><a name="niobe" id="niobe"></a>NIOBE.</h2>


<p>Apollo and Diana are both hunters and carry bows
and arrows. One day Niobe, queen of Thebes, boasted
that she had more children than Latona, the mother of
Apollo and Diana, and that her children were more
beautiful.</p>

<p>Latona called upon her children to punish Niobe for
her pride, and they shot their arrows at the children of
the boasting Niobe. Soon all were slain, although their
mother, in her grief, tried to protect those she loved
so well. Apollo killed the seven handsome sons, and
Diana aimed her arrows at the seven lovely daughters.</p>

<p>Niobe grieved so over the loss of her dear children
that she turned into stone, but her tears still continued
to flow.</p>

<p>There is a room in a famous gallery in Florence,
Italy, called the Niobe room, because here are placed
the famous statues of Niobe and her fourteen children,
trying, in vain, to escape the fatal arrows of the divine
archers.</p>

<p>Some people believe that this story means that the
rays of the sun and moon are harmful. But others say
that it only shows that Apollo, the sun, battles with
Niobe and her children, who are the powers of winter.
When his rays have overcome them, Niobe dissolves in
tears, and the cold snows melt and disappear.</p>

<h2><a name="jupiter" id="jupiter"></a>JUPITER.</h2>


<p>Jupiter, or Jove, as he is sometimes called, king of
the gods, lives in high Olympus, a mountain in Greece.
All the gods obey him, except the Fates, who are more
powerful than the gods.</p>

<p>Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, Diana, Mars, Minerva, Pluto,
Ceres, Mercury, Venus, Neptune, and Vesta are the
twelve gods whose home is on Mount Olympus. Vulcan
prefers his home in Mount Etna, and is generally
busy at work there. Pluto, also, is seldom away from
his underground home.</p>

<p>In the palace of Jupiter, all the questions in which
the gods are interested are discussed and settled.
Ceres came hither to ask Jupiter to restore her dear
Persephone. Cupid brought Psyche to Olympus after
their many trials on earth. Minerva and Neptune had
their celebrated contest for the honor of naming Athens,
in the presence of these gods.</p>

<p>Juno, the wife of Jupiter, sits at his left. She wears
a crown, and holds the royal scepter; for she is queen
of gods and men. Peacocks with many-colored feathers
draw her chariot, and Iris, with her rainbow wings, is
Juno&rsquo;s messenger.</p>

<p>Jupiter holds the terrible thunderbolts in his powerful
right hand, and on his left hand stands the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>107]</a></span>
goddess Victory. The eagle, king of birds, is sacred to
Jove.</p>

<p>He has dominion over the sky, the earth, and the
sea. As the clouds are continually changing their
shape, now piling up like great white mountains, now
looking like birds or fishes, Jupiter is said to change
his form to an eagle, a swan, a cloud, or a shower of
gold. He sometimes visits earth in mortal form, to see
if men are just and kind. When he finds them cruel or
wicked, he punishes them; but he rejoices to find those
who are generous, just, and helpful.</p>

<h2><a name="neptune" id="neptune"></a>NEPTUNE.</h2>


<p>Jupiter gave to Neptune, his brother, dominion over
the sea. He rides over the placid waves in his chariot,
made of shells of many colors, gleaming in the sunlight.
If he wishes a storm, he strikes upon the waves with
his trident, and calls the winds, and the huge billows
threaten the clouds. Tritons with wreathed horns follow
his chariot, and naiads as graceful as the waves
sport in the opaline waters.</p>

<p>The palaces of the water gods and nymphs are more
wonderful than those on earth. Shells, glistening sand,
corals, and sea mosses lend beauty of color and form.
The music of the waves lulls these beings to sleep.
They ride upon a dolphin&rsquo;s back, or are borne onward
by the waves,&mdash;free, happy, frolicking water sprites,
dashing the spray and diving in graceful play through
the deep waves of the sea.</p>

<p>Neptune is strong and calm. He is represented in
art as bearing the trident, and surrounded by his attendants
and the inhabitants of the sea. There is a celebrated
fountain in Rome adorned with a fine statue of
Neptune. It is said that a visitor who throws a coin
into its waters will return to that famous city.</p>

<p>Sailors used to take offerings to the temples of Neptune,
so that he would give them prosperous voyages.</p>

<h2><a name="vulcan" id="vulcan"></a>VULCAN.</h2>


<p>Vulcan, the son of Jupiter and Juno, is the blacksmith
of the gods. His forges are in the caverns of
volcanic mountains, where the fires are bright and
ready to heat the gold, silver, and iron, of which he has
made many wonderful things.</p>

<p>Vulcan built the magnificent palaces of the gods on
Mount Olympus, Juno&rsquo;s golden throne, and the chariot
of Apollo. The delicate girdle of Venus, the wife of
Vulcan, was also made in his workshop. This was a
magic girdle; for whoever wore it inspired love in all
she met, and sometimes the goddesses would beg Venus
to lend it to them.</p>

<p>The armor of Mars, god of war, and the shield of
Minerva, goddess of wisdom, were the work of Vulcan.
Sometimes he even manufactured armor for mortals,
and Homer tells us of the marvelous shield he wrought
for Achilles, the bravest of the Greeks. The most
powerful weapons that Vulcan made at his forges were
the dread thunderbolts of Jove and the arrows of mischievous
Cupid, the winged god of love.</p>

<p>Vulcan is represented as rather short and thickset,
lame in one foot, with a cap on his curly head, and a
hammer in his hand. His workmen are the Cyclops,
powerful giants, who excel in all work in metals.</p>

<h2><a name="venus" id="venus"></a>VENUS.</h2>


<p>Venus is the goddess of beauty, born of the ocean
spray. When the tritons and nymphs who live in the
sea beheld her, they loved her for her beauty, and the
waves and gentle breezes bore her to Olympus.</p>

<p>Venus is attended by three maidens called the Graces,
who give to the beauty of the goddess a charm which
makes her lovely to all.</p>

<p>When she came to Olympus, all the gods loved her,
but she proudly rejected the eager suitors. When
Jupiter, the king of the gods, fared no better than the
rest, he declared that she should be punished for her
pride and must marry Vulcan, the lame blacksmith
god who lived in the volcano, Mount Etna. Vulcan
was delighted with her grace and beauty, and made
for her a magic girdle, and the wonderful arrows of
Cupid.</p>

<p>Joy and mirth always attend the goddess of beauty.
Cupid, her son, the roguish god of love, is her constant
companion, and he sends his arrows wherever she
directs. Venus drives in a chariot drawn by graceful
swans. Cooing doves are her favorite birds, and roses
and myrtle are sacred to her.</p>

<p>At the wedding of Thetis, a water nymph, all the gods
and goddesses except Eris were seated at the banquet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"><!-- original location of illustration --></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>117]</a></span>
Eris is the goddess of discord, and she had not been
invited, as she always causes people to quarrel and so is
loved by no one. She was angry at this slight, and, coming
to the door of the banquet hall, she threw a golden
apple upon the table.</p>

<p>On the apple was written, &ldquo;To the fairest.&rdquo; Eris
knew that this would be an apple of discord, because all
the nymphs and goddesses were fair, and each would
claim to be fairer than the others.</p>

<p>After much discussion, the guests agreed that Juno,
Minerva, and Venus were fairer than all the others.
These three at last decided to go to Paris and let him
judge between them. Paris was a shepherd of Mount Ida,
in Troy, and before him the lovely trio appeared in all
their wonderful beauty. He held the apple long in his
hand, for all were so fair that it was very difficult to
decide. At last he gave the apple to Venus, and thus
decided that she was fairest of all the goddesses.</p>

<p>This decision is called the &ldquo;Judgment of Paris.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Artists have often tried to paint their ideals of Venus.
The most beautiful statues in the world, ideals of womanly
beauty, are those of this goddess. They are in
the galleries of the Old World. The one said to be the
most lovely is the Venus de Milo, in the gallery of the
Louvre, Paris.</p>

<h2><a name="cupid_and_psyche" id="cupid_and_psyche"></a>CUPID AND PSYCHE.</h2>


<p>There once lived a maid, called Psyche, who was so
very beautiful that the people who knew her thought
her more lovely than Venus. So they worshiped her,
and refused to place garlands and offerings upon the
shrines of the goddess.</p>

<p>Desiring to punish the people for their impiety, Venus
sent Cupid to destroy the innocent Psyche. Although
Cupid had used his weapons upon others, he himself
had never loved. But when he saw Psyche, he started
in surprise at her wonderful youthful beauty, and one of
his own arrows pricked his heart. So he loved her, and,
instead of obeying his mother&rsquo;s command, he carried her
away to his home on a distant mountain.</p>

<p>Here she lived in a palace of gleaming marble,
surrounded by gardens wherein were fragrant flowers
and sparkling fountains. But one thing troubled her.
Cupid had told her that he could visit her only during
the night, and so she had never seen his face.</p>

<p>One night Psyche yielded to her curiosity, and held a
lamp over him while he slept. Dear Love was so beautiful
as he lay there asleep, that she tipped the lamp in
her surprise, and a drop of oil fell upon his rounded
arm. Then he awoke and blamed Psyche for her
curiosity and lack of confidence, and, spreading his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>122]</a></span>
wings, flew far away to his home with the gods. Poor
Psyche wept bitterly, but Cupid did not return.</p>

<p>Psyche means the soul, and this story teaches that
love comes unsought and unseen to the soul which is
faithful and worthy; but if doubt and curiosity possess
the soul, love departs.</p>

<p>The Greeks chose the butterfly as the best emblem of
the soul of man, because it emerges from the chrysalis
state into which the caterpillar entered more beautiful
than before. Psyche, the soul, is thus shown in the
works of art with the wings of a butterfly, or holding
one of the exquisite creatures in her hand.</p>

<p>Poor Psyche wandered far. At last she found Venus,
whom she begged to have pity and restore Cupid to her.
Venus gave her many tasks to perform. Although
Psyche was often very tired, she knew she deserved to
work and suffer, because of her lack of faith in Cupid.
Finally, Venus sent her down to Hades, where King
Pluto and Queen Persephone reign, to bring back a box
of beauty ointment.</p>

<p>The way was long and rough and dark. But Psyche
persevered, and finally reached the river Styx. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>124]</a></span>
called to the grim boatman, Charon, to row her across.
He obeyed, and rowed her over the black river in his
dingy boat, and Persephone gave her the box. Psyche
was frightened by the terrible cries and the wretched
dark faces of the souls in Hades. But she thought only
of Love. Then all the monsters ceased to annoy her,
and she came safely to earth again.</p>

<p>Alas, when her work was so bravely done, why did
she yield to temptation? She thought Love would
think more of her if she were fairer, and she opened the
box to take just a little of the precious beauty ointment.
There was nothing in the box but a bad dream, which
immediately seized her, and she fell down in sleep.</p>

<p>Cupid loved and was sorry for Psyche, and he feared
that some misfortune had befallen her; so he spread his
wings and flew in search of the soul he loved. He soon
found her asleep by the roadside. He awoke her, and
together they went to Olympus, where Venus forgave
them, and permitted them to be married.</p>

<p>Now Love and the Soul belong together, and although
the way is dark and lonely and difficult, you must believe
that</p>

<h2><a name="st_valentines_day" id="st_valentines_day"></a>ST. VALENTINE&rsquo;S DAY.</h2>


<p>In the old Roman days, the people, in the month of
February, had a great feast, when they purified their
homes and made sacrifices to the gods. After this, the
young people had games, and one of them was like that
of our valentine box. In this box were placed the names
of maidens. The young men drew out the names, and
each must be a true and loyal knight, for the following
year, to the young woman whose name he drew.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;valentine&rdquo; comes from a kind Christian
monk, who was the friend of youth. We send valentines
to those we love, and you know there are emblems of
love and fidelity upon these pretty gifts. Here are the
cooing doves, the graceful swan, the rose, and the myrtle&mdash;all
sacred to Venus, goddess of love and beauty.
Cupid, her mischievous son, has his bow and quiver
filled with arrows with which to pierce the hearts of the
young. Here is the butterfly, the emblem of Psyche,
the Soul, whom Love chose to be his wife.</p>

<p>From the story of Cupid and Psyche we learn how
love ennobles the soul, purifying it of doubt, and raising
it to perfect faith. For this reason, we may well celebrate
the day of kind St. Valentine, by sending words of
love and gifts of affection to our friends, in the form
of dainty valentines.</p>

<h2><a name="phaethon" id="phaethon"></a>PHA&Euml;THON.</h2>


<p>Pha&euml;thon was the son of Apollo. One day he approached
the palace of his father and begged a favor.
Apollo was pleased with his youthful grace and beauty,
and promised to grant his desire. Pha&euml;thon then boldly
asked the great god of the sun for permission to drive
his horses for a single day.</p>

<p>Then did Apollo regret his hasty promise, and beg
Pha&euml;thon to ask anything but that&mdash;because it is so
dangerous to drive those fiery steeds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You know not what you ask, my son, I am the
only one who can drive the chariot of the sun safely
through the heavens. Even Jupiter himself would not
attempt so dangerous a task.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Pha&euml;thon was bold and proud, and finally Apollo
yielded. The horses were harnessed, the gates unbarred,
Pha&euml;thon seized the reins, and away they flew! The
horses knew that a weak hand held them, but they were
going uphill and kept well in the course. So Pha&euml;thon
grew careless, and when the zenith was reached the
horses paid no heed to his guidance.</p>

<p>Exulting in their freedom from Apollo&rsquo;s masterful
hand, they galloped far from the path, now on this side,
now on that.</p>

and grass withered, the crops were all destroyed, and
the streams disappeared. Then they turned so far
away that snow fell, and the people shivered and suffered
from the cold.</p>

<p>All the people on earth were afraid, and even the
gods on high Olympus wondered what was amiss with
Apollo, that his horses were so unruly.</p>

<p>Finally Jupiter looked over the heavens, and, seeing
the reckless Pha&euml;thon, hurled a thunderbolt at him, and
he fell headlong into the river Po.</p>

<p>Hither every day came his sisters, the Heliades, wringing
their hands and weeping for their beloved brother.
At length the gods changed them into poplar trees, and
their tears into amber.</p>

<p>Pha&euml;thon&rsquo;s dearest friend, Cygnus, was continually
plunging into the river, hoping to find the body of the
rash youth, and he was changed into a swan. This
bird now sails mournfully upon the waters, frequently
dipping his head below the surface, as if still searching
for his friend Pha&euml;thon.</p>

<h2><a name="mercury" id="mercury"></a>MERCURY.</h2>


<p>Mercury, or Hermes, is a very interesting god. He
is the messenger of Jupiter, and has wings on his cap
and sandals. He flies swifter than the wind and wears
a cloak which makes him invisible. As the wind carries
things away, Mercury is sometimes called the captain of
thieves, and he likes to play tricks.</p>

<p>While walking along a river bank one day, he carelessly
hit a tortoise shell, and it gave forth a musical
sound. Mercury at once fashioned it into a lyre. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>135]</a></span>
musical instrument he gave to his brother Apollo, who
was so delighted with it that he gave Mercury a wonderful
wand called the caduceus. When animals or people
quarrel, this wand will make them friends again. One
day Mercury threw it upon the ground where two
snakes were fighting, and at once they twined lovingly
about it, and Mercury kept them there as an emblem of
the power of the wand.</p>

<p>The caduceus represents the gift of language; for
when men quarrel and are angry, if they use this wand
and talk with each other, their differences will soon disappear
and they will become friends.</p>

<p>You will recognize the statues of Mercury by his
caduceus and by his winged cap and sandals. He is
sometimes represented as standing upon a tongue; for
he gave to man the gift of speech, and is the god of eloquence.
Mercury is also the god of commerce; for if
men could not speak and converse with one another,
there would be no commerce in the world.</p>

<h2><a name="aeolus" id="aeolus"></a>&AElig;OLUS.</h2>


<p>All nature is musical. If you will listen, you can hear
the leaves singing sweet songs, and the reeds along the
river banks join in with their voices. The brooks and
the rivers sing and laugh; they are so happy shining
in the golden sun, or hiding in the cool shade.</p>

<p>The fairies have the flowers for their musical bells,
and the grasses sing softly to the dear mother earth.
But the sweetest songs are the carols of the merry birds,
and the songs of happy children.</p>

<p>The winds are often noisy, but sometimes they seem
to sing a musical song. Some instruments in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>138]</a></span>
orchestra, the flute and the horn, are called wind instruments.
There is a simple stringed instrument, called
the &aelig;olian harp. When the winds blow upon its sensitive,
delicate strings, musical sounds are heard, and we
say that &AElig;olus, king of the winds, is playing upon his
harp.</p>

<p>Long ago, the Lipari Islands, off the coast of Italy,
were called the &AElig;olian Islands. Here in a rocky cave
lived &AElig;olus and the winds, who were the children of
Aurora and &AElig;olus. All the winds were noisy and fond
of strife except Zephyrus, the youngest. &AElig;olus kept
them fastened in the rocky cave, generally letting out
but one at a time. They were always rushing to the
iron doors, quarreling and fighting among themselves,
and begging &AElig;olus to let them out of the narrow cave.</p>

<p>Whenever one of the gods wished a storm at sea, he
would ask &AElig;olus to release his sons; they would rush
out of the cave, sweeping over the seas in a whirlwind,
raising the waves mountain high. Then the ships were
in great danger from wave and rock, as the winds rolled
the billows over the ships, or drove the vessels against
the sharp cliffs.</p>

<p>Vergil, the great Latin poet, thus describes a storm
raised by &AElig;olus, at the request of Juno,&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem40">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&ldquo;&AElig;olus thus in reply: &lsquo;It is yours, O queen, to determine<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Turning, he struck with his spear the side of the cavernous mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as in martial array, wherever an egress is granted,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eagerly pour forth the winds, and sweep o&rsquo;er the earth in a whirlwind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now on the sea have they fallen, and stirred to its deepest foundations;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eastward and southward together, and blasts of the gusty southwest wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lash it all into a fury, and roll to the shore the vast billows.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then on a sudden collecting, the clouds, from the sight of the Trojans<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shut out the sky and the day, o&rsquo;er the sea broods the darkness of midnight;<br /></span>

<h2><a name="aeolus_and_ulysses" id="aeolus_and_ulysses"></a>&AElig;OLUS AND ULYSSES.</h2>


<p>The famous Trojan war lasted ten years. After the
Greeks had captured the city, they were anxious to return
to their homes in Greece. One of the heroes, the
wise Ulysses, had many strange adventures on his way
home from Troy. At last he and his men came in their
ship to &AElig;olia, the home of the winds, where they were
welcomed and entertained by &AElig;olus.</p>

<p>&AElig;olus was so pleased with his guests that, when the
time came for Ulysses to continue his journey, the god
gave him a bag with all the dangerous winds shut up
within it. Only one wind was not inclosed in the bag&mdash;Zephyrus,
the gentle south wind, which filled the
sails and bore him on his journey.</p>

<p>After eight days, Ulysses came in sight of Ithaca, the
home he had so long desired to see. He had not slept
since leaving &AElig;olia. Now, within sight of his home,
he believed that he and his ship were safe, and he
yielded to his desire for rest. The sailors were very
glad to see him sleep, for they wanted to know what
Ulysses had in the bag he so carefully guarded. They
thought it was filled with gold and precious stones.</p>

<p>Alas! when the avaricious sailors opened the bag, the
winds rushed out in fury and drove them far from their
homes. At last they were again cast upon the shores
of the &AElig;olian Islands.</p>

<h2><a name="the_wind_tower" id="the_wind_tower"></a>THE WIND TOWER.</h2>


<p>In Athens is a temple called the Tower of the Winds.
There the people came to offer sacrifices to the winds,
and to hold games in their honor. The Athenians felt
that the winds had great power, and therefore they built
this beautiful tower. The tower has eight sides, and
on each side is sculptured a representation of one of the
winds.</p>

<p>All of the winds are shown with wings, and in a flying
posture. Boreas, Aquilo, and Corus are the destructive
winds, and are terrible in appearance. Boreas, the north
wind, is the father of storms at sea, and carries a triton&rsquo;s
horn. Aquilo, the northeast wind, is showering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>144]</a></span>
hailstones, and Corus, the dry and parching northwest wind,
has in his hand a vessel of charcoal.</p>

<p>The east wind, which in Greece is a pleasant wind, is
carrying fruit and flowers. The rainy southeast wind,
Eurus, is forming rain clouds; while Notus, the south
wind, who brings the sudden storms of rain, is pouring
rain from a jar. The southwest wind carries an ornament
which was always placed at the stern of every
ancient ship, for it was an important wind to the sailors
of Greece. Zephyrus, the welcome west wind, has a lap
filled with spring flowers.</p>

<p>The gentle Zephyrus married Flora, goddess of the
springtime. Together they wander joyously over all
lands, bringing happiness to the people. The south
wind wakes the flowers, and as Zephyrus and Flora
pass, violets, pansies, daffodils, and roses lift their pretty
heads, and fill the land with beauty and fragrance.</p>

<p>The Indians tell the story that once Mudjekeewis, a
mighty hunter, killed the great bear of the mountains.
Mudjekeewis found the bear asleep, and after stealthily
taking off the belt of wampum which the bear wore, he
smote him in the middle of his forehead and stunned
him. They fought, and Mudjekeewis conquered.</p>

<p>When he returned home, he told of his victory, and
showed the magic belt. The Indians praised him for
his bravery, and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Mudjekeewis shall rule over
the winds of heaven. He shall be king of the winds,
and shall be called Kabeyun, the West-Wind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mudjekeewis has three sons&mdash;Wabun, Shawondasee,

he gave the east wind; to Shawondasee the south wind,

<h2><a name="wabun" id="wabun"></a>WABUN.</h2>


<p>Wabun was the son of Mudjekeewis. He was young
and beautiful. When he came from the east in the
morning, his breath was fresh with the perfume of
flowers, and he painted the sky with streaks of crimson
and gold. He woke the deer and called the hunters,
and chased the dark over hill and valley.</p>

<p>But Wabun was lonely in the sky, and, although the
birds sang to him and the rivers and the forests shouted
at his coming, he longed for a friend to be with him
always.</p>

<p>One day, when a fog lay on the river, he looked
toward the earth and saw a slender maiden walking all
alone upon the meadow. She was gathering water flags
and bulrushes, which grew along the margin of the
river. Her eyes were as blue as two blue lakes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>147]</a></span>
Wabun loved the graceful maiden, for she was alone
on the earth as he was alone in the heavens. So he
drew her to his bosom, and changed her into a beautiful
star.</p>

<p>They are still found together in the eastern sky,
Wabun and the Wabun-Annung, the east wind and the
morning star.</p>

<h2><a name="shawondasee" id="shawondasee"></a>SHAWONDASEE.</h2>


<p>Shawondasee, fat and lazy, rules the south wind. He
lives in the warm and pleasant south land, the land of
perpetual summer. He sends us the beautiful Indian
summer in November, the month of snowshoes, that we
may not forget him during the long, cold winter.</p>

<p>Once Shawondasee thought he saw a maiden with
golden tresses standing far away in the meadow. He
loved her, but was too lazy to bestir himself to woo her.
After watching her for some time, and always loving
her, alas! her golden hair changed to white floss and was
blown about the prairie.</p>

<p>Shawondasee was sad, and he thought that his brother
Kabibonokka had turned her hair from gold to white.
But it was no maiden he had seen. It was only the
prairie dandelion.</p>

<h2><a name="kabibonokka" id="kabibonokka"></a>KABIBONOKKA.</h2>


<p>To the fierce Kabibonokka, Mudjekeewis gave the
cold and cruel north wind. He lives far away toward
the north in the regions of ice and snow. In the autumn
and winter he comes out from his home, and
travels toward the south.</p>

<p>He stamps upon the rivers, and the waters freeze.
Frost pictures appear upon the windowpanes, the birds
fly southward, and no one remains in the kingdom of
the north wind but the Diver. This brave Diver cares
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>152]</a></span>
not for the cold or for the stormy north wind. He sits
in his wigwam, merry and warm; for he has four great
logs for his fire, and each log will last a month. Kabibonokka
enters the wigwam, but cannot stand the heat,
and so taunts the Diver and dares him to a combat in
the open air. Long they fight; but at length the Diver
conquers, and the cold and fierce Kabibonokka is driven
back into his kingdom of the north.</p>

<p>The Diver is the glorious sun, who, with his warm
golden beams, beats back the cold, and brings the
pleasant summer with the birds and flowers.</p>

<h2><a name="iris" id="iris"></a>IRIS.</h2>


<p>The Greeks lived much in the open air, and they
loved to watch the fleecy clouds float lazily across the
blue heavens, or at night to see the bright, golden
stars shine down upon them like friendly eyes. They
believed that Juno was goddess of the heavens when
they were calm and peaceful, as Jupiter was god of the
storm cloud and of the thunderbolt.</p>

<p>Whenever they saw the radiant rainbow, they said,
&ldquo;There is the glowing Iris, the messenger of Juno,
carrying some message from the sky to the earth.&rdquo;
They thought that Iris had shining wings of various
colors, and that while she stayed upon earth, you could
see her path in the heavens marked by the many-colored
rainbow.</p>

<h2><a name="rainbow_stories" id="rainbow_stories"></a>RAINBOW STORIES.</h2>


<p>The Indians had a lovely thought about the rainbow,&mdash;perhaps
more beautiful than the belief of the Greeks.</p>

<p>You know how sweet and beautiful the flowers are, how
we love the roses, the lilies, the pansies, and the golden-rod,
and how sorry we are to have them leave us when
the cold winds blow.</p>

<p>The Indians also loved the flowers; and they fancied,
when they saw such lovely colors in the rainbow which
spans the heavens, that all the wild flowers&mdash;the lilies,
the buttercups, and windflowers, the dainty violets and
the moss of the woods&mdash;were still living and blossoming
in the heavens.</p>

<p>Our poet Longfellow has told us about this myth in
his &ldquo;Song of Hiawatha.&rdquo; The little Hiawatha</p>

<h2><a name="narcissus" id="narcissus"></a>NARCISSUS.</h2>


<p>Narcissus was a vain youth, and loved no one but
himself. One day, while looking into a quiet stream,
he thought he saw a lovely naiad in the water gazing up
at him.</p>

<p>He smiled upon her, and she also smiled. Day after
day he came to the bank and begged the lovely naiad
to come out of the water, and roam with him through
the flowery meadows of earth. Every day he believed
she would come; for she seemed to smile upon him and
welcome him, even as he spoke and smiled upon her.</p>

<p>Some days, when the waters were dark and ruffled
by the wind, he could not see her blue eyes and golden
ringlets, and he thought she was vexed with him.</p>

<p>He never knew it was his own face he saw reflected
in the water, and at last, after weary watching and waiting,
he pined away and died. Echo and all the nymphs
of the stream and of the grove mourned for him. He
was beautiful even in death, for the gods had changed
him into a flower. His pale face and golden hair were
changed into the delicate narcissus, which delights us
with its graceful form and rare fragrance.</p>

<p>The narcissus grows upon the margin of streams,
and, bending over the waters, seems to admire its image
mirrored there.</p>

<h2><a name="echo_and_narcissus" id="echo_and_narcissus"></a>ECHO AND NARCISSUS.</h2>


<p>Diana had many young and lovely nymphs, who
attended her in her rambles over the wooded hills.
Among these maids was Echo, a very graceful and
merry nymph of the mountain. Echo had one serious
fault, however. She was too fond of talking, and was
always anxious to say the last word.</p>

<p>One day she angered Juno, with whom she was talking,
and the goddess punished her severely. She said,&mdash;&ldquo;Echo,
this shall be your punishment for trying to
deceive me. You may still have the last word as you
are so fond of it, but never the first. You shall not
have the power to begin the conversation; you may
only reply.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soon after this Echo met Narcissus, a handsome
youth who was hunting upon the mountain. She admired
his grace and skill in the hunt and wished very
much to join in the chase. But she could not speak to
him, and when he called to his companions she could
only repeat the last words. Narcissus did not care to
please the nymph, and so refused to speak with her or
to allow her to join in the hunt.</p>

repeating your words softly from a distance. But you

<h2><a name="minerva" id="minerva"></a>MINERVA.</h2>


<p>The wonderful goddess Minerva is said to have come
full-grown from the brain of her father, Jupiter, king of
the gods. She is tall, and clad in full armor. Her
name Minerva means &ldquo;mind.&rdquo; She is called the goddess
of wisdom, and she took the throne which the stupid
goddess Dullness had held before. Unlike Mars,
Minerva does not love war, but she is very brave when
compelled to fight.</p>

<p>A city in Greece was to be named, and Neptune and
Minerva contended for the honor. The gods decided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>165]</a></span>
that the one who produced the article most valuable to
man should name the city.</p>

<p>Neptune struck the ground with his trident, and there
sprang forth a horse, strong and noble. All admired
Neptune&rsquo;s gift, and did not believe that Minerva could
surpass him.</p>

<p>When Minerva produced the olive tree, they laughed,
and all thought that Neptune had won. But the goddess
told them that the olive tree could furnish wood
for fire, for building houses, and for making many useful
articles; that food and oil could be obtained from
it; and that even clothing could be made from its fiber.</p>

<p>The gods then said that, while men could live without
horses, they could not live without food, warmth, and
shelter, and Minerva had the honor of naming the city.</p>

<p>Minerva was called Pallas Athene by the Greeks, and
so the city in Greece was named Athens. In this city
was erected a beautiful temple in her honor, called the
Parthenon. Its ruins are still standing.</p>

<p>In this temple was a magnificent statue of Minerva,
made by the great sculptor Phidias. It was of ivory and
gold. The goddess wears a long cloak and a helmet,
and carries a shield and spear. At her feet is coiled
a serpent, the emblem of wisdom. Minerva has clear
blue eyes, is always calm and dignified, and helps all
those who wish to excel in wisdom, or to obtain skill
in the arts of peace.</p>

<h2><a name="minerva_and_arachne" id="minerva_and_arachne"></a>MINERVA AND ARACHNE.</h2>


<p>Arachne was a young girl who was famous for her
skill in embroidery and weaving. All the women of
Greece knew that she excelled in this feminine work,
and they liked to see her with her loom or needle.
Even the nymphs, who love to sport about the fountains
and in the groves, would leave their play to watch her.</p>

<p>It was pleasant to see her deftly separate the wool,
and card it until it was soft and fleecy as down. Then
dexterously twirling the spindle, she wove the web so
quickly and easily that one watched her fingers with
delight. Under her skillful touch, the trees in her tapestry
seemed to bend before the gentle breeze, and the
flowers were so perfect that they were as beautiful as
those growing in the gardens.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minerva, the goddess of weaving, must be her
teacher,&rdquo; said all who saw her wonderful work.</p>

<p>But this did not please Arachne, who was vain and
proud. &ldquo;I am my own teacher,&rdquo; she said, with a saucy
toss of her pretty head, &ldquo;and Minerva herself cannot
compete with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This proud boast Minerva heard. The gods do not
like such boasting, and Minerva determined to correct
her or to punish her. She changed her form, and appeared
before Arachne as a wise old woman.</p>

&ldquo;My child,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;do not challenge a goddess.
Your work is beautiful and deserves praise, but Minerva&rsquo;s
skill is that of a goddess. You are a mortal,
and you should ask forgiveness of Minerva for your rash
speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Arachne was angry at these wise words, and replied:
&ldquo;I do not wish your advice. I do not fear the goddess,
and do not ask her forgiveness. If she is not afraid, let
her come, and we will compare our work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lo! as she spoke, Minerva dropped her disguise, and
stood revealed&mdash;a goddess. All around were amazed,
and trembled before the glorious Minerva, except the
angry Arachne.</p>

<p>Her friends tried to influence her to give up the
contest, and to ask Minerva to forgive her irreverent
words. But Arachne still thought she could excel the
goddess in weaving, and, as Minerva said no more, the
contest began.</p>

<p>Each took her place. Wools of different dyes were
given them. Both worked with speed, and the slender
shuttle seemed to fly under their fingers.</p>

<p>Arachne showed Leda and the swan, and Europa and
the bull, with such fidelity to nature that they seemed
to move and breathe. But the goddess showed her contest
with Neptune. Twelve of the great gods were represented.
Neptune with his trident had just produced
the horse, that animal so strong and so useful to man.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>169]</a></span>
Minerva stood with her helmet and shield, showing her
gift to man&mdash;the olive tree.</p>

<p>All the beholders saw that Minerva had surpassed
Arachne, and felt that the proud girl must be punished
for her pride and impiety. Minerva, more in pity than
in anger, touched Arachne&rsquo;s forehead and said, &ldquo;Live,
guilty woman, and thus shall you preserve the memory
of this lesson to all future times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Speaking thus, the goddess changed the hapless
Arachne into a spider. If you look at a spider&rsquo;s web,
you will see that the descendants of Arachne still show
great patience and skill, and spin wonderful webs.</p>

<h2><a name="prometheus" id="prometheus"></a>PROMETHEUS.</h2>


<p>The gods told the wise Prometheus to bestow gifts
upon all the animals of the earth, according to their
need. So to the deer he gave swiftness; to the lion,
courage; to the horse, strength; to the eagle, strong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>172]</a></span>
pinions; to the ox, patience; to the dog, keenness of
scent; and to the nightingale, a melodious voice.</p>

<p>After the animals had all received special gifts, the
gods told Prometheus to make man to rule over them.
Prometheus made man after the image of the gods, but
smaller and weaker, and Minerva gave to him mind and
soul. Prometheus loved the man he had made, but as
he had already bestowed all the gifts he had upon the
animals, for a long time he could not think of a way in
which to give man power over them. At last he decided
that he must obtain for man the gift of fire.</p>

<p>But how could he get this wonderful element? He
knew that Jupiter would never grant it; for fire belonged
to Apollo, the god of the sun, and punishment would be
inflicted upon any one who attempted to obtain it by
stealth or by force. Yet his love for man prevailed over
his fear and by night he approached the chariot wheels
of the sun and stole some fire, bringing it to earth in a
hollow tube. With this power, man conquers the cold,
makes the minerals plastic, forces his way through
mountains, and crosses deep seas.</p>

<p>When Jupiter discovered that Prometheus had bestowed
this great gift on man, he punished him very
severely; but Prometheus endured the punishment
bravely, conscious that man would always profit by his
daring. Prometheus has always been called the friend
of man, and many poets have written in his honor.</p>

<h2><a name="adonis" id="adonis"></a>ADONIS.</h2>


<p>Adonis was a youth of wonderful beauty. Tall and
lithe and graceful, he seemed like a young god, although
he was but a mortal. He was fond of hunting, and day
after day found him roaming over the hills and through
the forests with his bow and arrows. His step was
light and bounding, and he seemed to belong to the life
of the hills as much as the trees and flowers.</p>

<p>Tired with the hunt, he would throw himself upon
the leafy turf and look up through the great branches
of the trees to the azure skies.</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he could understand what the
leaves were saying, as they rustled in the breeze. The
clouds made him think of white-sailed boats floating on
a blue sea, and he wished that he could sail with them
to the home of the god of the golden sun. The grass
seemed to whisper to him and tell him the secrets of the
earth mother, and the streams leaping down the mountain
sides seemed to laugh joyously and to call upon
him to follow.</p>

<p>Adonis did not care for city life; the woods held all
of beauty for him. And he was not at all surprised,
one day, when he saw Venus coming towards him, her
beauty radiant in the sunlight. She seemed to him to
be at home in the woods he loved so well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>175]</a></span>
Venus loved Adonis, and they went hunting together.
Adonis was bold, and wished to chase the larger game;
but Venus warned him against the fierce wild boars and
the wolves. When Venus was with Adonis, he listened
to her advice. But in her absence, one day, he pursued
a wild boar. His arrow struck the boar and angered
him. Fiercely the animal sprang upon the youthful
hunter, and thrust his tusks through his side, and
Adonis sank in death.</p>

<p>Venus grieved for his death. &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;why did you hunt the cruel beasts which care not for
youth or grace or beauty? Long shall I lament your
untimely death, Adonis. From your blood a flower
shall spring to keep your memory upon the earth, and
people shall say, &lsquo;This is the flower of Adonis.&rsquo;&rdquo; At
that moment blossomed the tender anemone, the windflower,
which every spring adorns the warm hillsides.</p>

<p>This myth has almost the same meaning as the myth
of Ceres and Persephone. When the youthful Adonis,
the springtime of the year, is hunting over the hills and
valleys, Venus, the cherishing mother, is glad and happy
in his presence, and all the earth is filled with flower
and fruit.</p>

<p>But before the tusk of the wild boar, the cruel and
frosty winter, Adonis is slain; and Venus grieves, as
Ceres laments when Persephone is in the kingdom of
Pluto.</p>

<h2><a name="the_apples_of_the_hesperides" id="the_apples_of_the_hesperides"></a>THE APPLES OF THE HESPERIDES.</h2>


<p>Far away in the west was a beautiful land that belonged
to King Hesperus. This king had three lovely
daughters who cared for the fruits and flowers of the
gardens. In the gardens were many graceful trees
whose boughs bent under the weight of delicious fruit.
Flowers red, yellow, and orange adorned the walks.</p>

<p>When Juno, goddess of the sky, married Jupiter, her
sister Ceres gave her a handsome present. Ceres is the
earth goddess who cultivates the fruits, flowers, and
grains, and the best gift she could bestow upon her
sister was some golden apples.</p>

<p>Juno prized these apples highly, and gave them to the
Hesperides, the daughters of Hesperus. They placed
them upon the shadiest tree of the garden, and watched
and cared for them very carefully.</p>

<p>Once they were taken away by Hercules, the strong
hero who performed many wonderful labors, but they
were afterwards restored to the careful hands of the
maidens.</p>

<p>Many heroes heard of the beautiful land, Hesperia,
and of the wonderful apples growing there, and sailed
westward to find them. Some people think that the
golden apples were really the oranges of Spain, a rich
and famous country west of Greece.</p>

<h2><a name="pandora" id="pandora"></a>PANDORA.</h2>


<p>Vulcan was always trying his skill, and he made
many wonderful and beautiful things. One day he
invited the gods to see his latest creation. Here stood
a beautiful figure, resembling Venus in beauty. The
gods were delighted with his work, and decided each
to bestow upon the woman some excellent gift.</p>

<p>Minerva gave skill in handicraft, Mercury gave wit
in conversation, Venus the power to please, the Graces
added charm to her beauty, and Jupiter at last gave life
and immortality. Because of these many gifts, she was
named Pandora, a Greek word meaning &ldquo;all gifts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The gods sent Pandora to Prometheus and Epimetheus,
the brothers who loved mankind. Prometheus
would not receive the lovely maiden, for he knew the
gods did not love him and he feared their gifts. But
Epimetheus welcomed her to his home.</p>

<p>For some time they lived happily, but trouble came to
them because of Pandora&rsquo;s curiosity. In the palace of
Epimetheus was a quaintly carved box. Pandora had
wondered what was in it, for Epimetheus did not know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The winged messenger brought it,&rdquo; he told her,
&ldquo;and said that it contained a secret of the immortal
gods. We must not open it, dear Pandora, for mortals
should not know the secrets of the immortals.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>181]</a></span>
But Pandora was not to be satisfied. Day after day
the longing grew upon her to open the box. She believed
it contained beautiful garments or ornaments, and
she said to herself: &ldquo;Why should the gods leave the box
here, if we must not open it? There are many places
where they could have hidden it.&rdquo; So she persuaded
herself that she would not be doing wrong to open the
box, although a little voice seemed to warn her not to
disobey.</p>

<p>Slowly she approached the box. The figures upon
it seemed to smile upon her. She thought she would
open it just a little and peep in. Poor Pandora! The
moment she lifted the cover, all the sorrow and sickness
and sin which had been shut up in this wonderful
box, flew out and winged their way all over the earth.</p>

<p>Pandora was overcome with remorse and let the cover
fall. In the midst of her grief, she heard a sweet voice
say, &ldquo;Pandora, dear Pandora, do not grieve so; let me
out to comfort you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Pandora; &ldquo;too many of your
sisters and brothers have I let out already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the voice persisted, and was so kind and gentle
that at last Pandora yielded, and Hope came forth to
comfort and help man to endure all the evils of this life.
In sickness or sorrow, hope points to happier to-morrows,
and when we have done wrong and repent, hope
encourages us to do what we know is right.</p>

<p>As you know, the home of the gods and goddesses
was a mountain in Greece called Olympus. It is the
loftiest mountain of that country, and its top is often
encircled by clouds. Here were the marble palaces of
the gods. On this mountain, they would meet in council
to decide upon the fate of mortals, or they would
come together for a merry feast.</p>

<p>Fair Hebe, the goddess of youth, was their cupbearer.
It was her duty to pour out the delicious
nectar. She was so graceful and light-footed that
she seemed to float rather than to walk. The rosy
light of youth and health shone from her bright eyes
and glowing cheeks.</p>

<p>But, alas! one day she stumbled, and some of the
nectar fell upon the marble floor. The gods demand
perfect service, and dislike awkwardness, so poor Hebe
was in disgrace. Although she was the daughter of
Jupiter and Juno, she could no longer serve the gods,
and Jupiter sought another cupbearer.</p>

<p>This god can assume any shape he chooses, and as
an eagle he flew over the lands until he saw Ganymede,
the son of a Trojan king. Jupiter was so pleased with
him that he carried him to high Olympus for cupbearer
in place of Hebe.</p>

<h2><a name="vesta" id="vesta"></a>VESTA.</h2>


<p>A beautiful little building in Rome is called the
Temple of Vesta. Hundreds of years have passed since
the Romans built this shrine. Many buildings and
temples erected since have been destroyed, but this little
temple still stands to show the thought and the artistic
taste of the old Romans.</p>

<p>Vesta is the goddess of the hearth. Fire is the emblem
of friendship and hospitality, and in the temple
of Vesta the fire was kept burning night and day.
The Romans believed that if this fire went out, great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>187]</a></span>
trouble would come upon the people. So maidens were
chosen to guard the fire and honor the goddess.</p>

<p>Little girls, six years old, were taken from the best
families in Rome, for it was considered a great honor to
be chosen. For ten years they were taught the duties
of a vestal virgin. Then for ten years they served the
goddess at her altar fires, and after that they became
the teachers of the young children.</p>

<p>When a great general had won a victory over the
enemies of Rome, and all the people gathered to celebrate
the return of the soldiers from the battlefield, the
vestal virgins had an honored place in the procession.
At the great games held in the Coliseum, the vestals sat
next to the emperor; for they guarded the fire of home&mdash;the
dearest place on earth.</p>

<h2><a name="the_origin_of_the_moss_rose" id="the_origin_of_the_moss_rose"></a>THE ORIGIN OF THE MOSS ROSE.</h2>


<p>One beautiful summer day a fairy saw a butterfly
with golden wings. He tried to catch the lovely insect,
and it led him a merry chase from flower to flower. At
last the fairy found himself in a strange wood, and he
did not know the way home. The sun had set, the
wind had gone away, and no one could direct him.</p>

<p>Wearied with his search, he determined to rest until
the moon rose, when the fairies would come forth to
dance upon the mossy banks. He looked about him
for a resting place, and asked a stately lily to let
him sleep on her broad leaves; but the petals were
closed, and she would not receive him. Many flowers
refused him shelter. At last, worn out and almost hopeless,
he came to a rose. This lovely flower spread
wide her soft, fragrant petals as a downy couch for the
tired fairy.</p>

<p>After a quiet nap he awoke, rested and grateful, and
asked the rose what return he could make for her kindness.
The rose bowed her pretty head, and replied,
&ldquo;Make me more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fairy looked at the rose blushing in the silvery
moonlight, and wondered how she could be more lovely.
Soon he noticed the dainty green moss at his feet, and
drew a delicate veil of it over the rose.</p>

<h2><a name="orpheus_and_eurydice" id="orpheus_and_eurydice"></a>ORPHEUS AND EURYDICE.</h2>


<p>The Greeks said that Orpheus was a handsome
youth, who loved music and song. He was the son of
Apollo and the muse Calliope.</p>

<p>Apollo, who is god of music, loved his son, and gave
him a lyre with golden strings. When he played upon
this musical lyre, and sang words of harmony and love,
all the voices of nature became silent to listen. The
ocean waves ceased their strife, the noisy winds said
&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; and the flowers turned their pretty heads to
listen to his strains.</p>

<p>Orpheus loved his wife Eurydice dearly, and when
she died, he would not be comforted. One day, lonely
and sad, he took his lyre and wandered to the mountains.</p>

<p>Soon he struck his strings, and the words he sang
were so mournful that the trees leaned down their
branches to comfort him, the rocks on the mountain
side moved to follow him, the flowers bent their tender
heads and their eyes filled with tears of sympathy, while
the rippling brooks sighed in pity. All nature seemed
sad, and the glorious sun drew a heavy cloud about him.</p>

<p>Now the gods who dwell on high Olympus heard his

Therefore, the king of gods sent Mercury to tell

Orpheus to search for his loved Eurydice in Hades.
Such was the power of his music that Cerberus with
the three great heads, the fierce watchdog of Hades,
licked his feet, and let him pass. All the souls of the
wicked who were suffering punishment for their sins,
when they heard his heavenly music, forgot their torments,
and ceased from suffering.</p>

<p>Finally Eurydice appeared. Imagine the joy of that
meeting! Pluto, won by the melody of Orpheus, said
that Eurydice might return to earth with her husband,
if Orpheus would lead the way, and not look back
until after she had crossed the threshold.</p>

<p>But, alas! Just as the lovely Eurydice stood in the
doorway, the anxious Orpheus looked back. His great
love and longing overcame his prudence. A last loving
glance, and they were separated, until gentle Death took
Orpheus by the hand and led him to her.</p>

<p>This charming myth shows us how music wins all
hearts, and, with those wonderful harmonies which tell
us that God, who is the maker of all harmony, is guiding
us all, helps us to endure pain and loneliness.</p>

<h2><a name="arion" id="arion"></a>ARION.</h2>


<p>Arion was a famous musician who lived at the court
of Periander, King of Corinth. He wished to compete
for the prize in the musical contest, celebrated in Sicily
in honor of Apollo. But Periander, who loved the
musician, dreaded to have him go so far away. Arion
entreated him, saying,&mdash;&ldquo;I wish to make the people
better and happier by the gift which the gods have given
me. It is my duty to Apollo to sing in his honor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So Arion went to Sicily, and his music was so excellent
and so sweet that he won the great prize. The
gold and the laurel wreath were put on board the ship,
and he embarked for home. Wind and wave were favorable,
the sky was clear. He gave thanks to Apollo
for his good fortune, and promised to offer sacrifices in
the temple.</p>

<p>The wicked sailors, however, knew that Arion had a
large amount of gold and jewels in his chests. They
gathered around him and told him that he must die.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want my gold?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That you may
have and welcome, but spare my life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the sailors did not dare let him go to Periander,
knowing that the king loved him and would have them
punished for the robbery. They said they would kill
him in the ship, or he might plunge into the sea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[<span class="hidden">Pg </span>199]</a></span>
Arion was brave and chose to give his life to the
waves. He dressed as if going to a festival, with his
handsomest garments, his jewels, and a crown of golden
laurel leaves. Taking his lyre, he played so exquisitely
that even the cruel sailors were moved to pity, but the
thought of his gold hardened their hearts.</p>

<p>As he plunged beneath the waves, a dolphin, charmed
by his music, offered its broad back for him to ride upon.</p>

<p>The sailors thought him drowned and continued on
their way. Meanwhile Arion journeyed on, singing and
playing as he went. The dolphin bore him safely to
the shore. He reached Corinth, and told his friend
Periander of the treachery of the sailors.</p>

<p>When the ship arrived, the sailors landed and were
conducted to the palace. &ldquo;Where is Arion?&rdquo; asked
Periander. &ldquo;Has he not returned?&rdquo; The sailors replied
that he was safe in Tarentum.</p>

<p>At this moment Arion appeared, tall and handsome,
wearing elegant robes and shining jewels. Amazed to
see one whom they believed dead, the sailors fell on
their knees and cried,&mdash;&ldquo;We murdered him, and he has
become a god! O earth, open and receive us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the king, &ldquo;the gods delight to honor
the poet, and they have saved the life of one whose music
charms all hearts but yours. Arion does not desire your
death. Go, avaricious souls, and never know the joy that
beauty and music can bring.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HESE readers form a good all-round basal series, suitable
for use in any school; but they will appeal to
teachers particularly, because of their very easy gradation.
Both in thought and expression, the books are so carefully
graded that each selection is but slightly more difficult than
the preceding one, and there is no real gap anywhere.</p>

<p>&para; Although a wide variety of reading matter is provided,
good literature, embodying child interests, has been considered
of fundamental importance. Lessons of a similar nature are
grouped together, and topics relating to kindred subjects recur
somewhat regularly. All are designed to quicken the child&rsquo;s
observation, and increase his appreciation.</p>

<p>&para; By the use of this series, the child will be taught to read in
such a manner as will appeal to his interests, and at the same time
he will be made acquainted with the masterpieces of many famous
writers. He will gain a knowledge of many subjects, and
acquire pure and attractive ideals of life and conduct. His imagination
will be cultivated by pleasing tales of fancy, and he will
also be taught a love of country, and given glimpses into the
life of other lands.</p>

<p>&para; The books are very attractive in mechanical appearance,
and contain a large number of original illustrations, besides
reproductions of many celebrated paintings.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE purpose of this book is to assist the pupil in using
words correctly in any one of three relations, viz.: in
speech, in oral reading, and in written composition.
Its exercises recognize the laws of association, and provide a
systematic drill in orthography, orthoepy, word-building, word-analysis,
and other phases of word-study.</p>

<p>&para; The vocabulary of the book is made up of words used
by the pupil in his other studies, and in his every-day
experience. The work is clearly laid out and graded;
reviews are amply provided, both by duplication and by
dictation work.</p>

<p>&para; PART ONE contains a vocabulary of some 4,000 word-forms
in common use, selected and graded with great care.
The arrangement is such that there is afforded a variety of
exercises, each containing an average of 20 words. The
phonetic, the topical, the grammatical, and the antithetic and
synonymic methods have received special treatment. Dictation
exercises, including memory gems, illustrative sentences,
and reviews, are also given.</p>

<p>&para; PART TWO includes a vocabulary of about 5,000 word-forms,
the exercises being devoted to topical lessons, phonetic
drills, pronouncing drill, grammatical forms, synonyms and
antonyms, applications of rules of spelling, drill on homophones,
word-building and word-analysis, words the derivation
of which is indicated, and derivatives from Latin and
Greek roots. Great emphasis is laid on prefixes and suffixes,
the origin of words, and pronunciation.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">S</span>PENCERS&rsquo; PRACTICAL WRITING has been devised
because of the distinct and wide-spread reaction from the
use of vertical writing in schools. It is thoroughly up-to-date,
embodying all the advantages of the old and of the
new. Each word can be written by one continuous movement
of the pen.</p>

<p>&para; The books teach a plain, practical hand, moderate in slant,
and free from ornamental curves, shades, and meaningless
lines. The stem letters are long enough to be clear and unmistakable.
The capitals are about two spaces in height.</p>

<p>&para; The copies begin with words and gradually develop into
sentences. The letters, both large and small, are taught
systematically. In the first two books the writing is somewhat
larger than is customary because it is more easily learned
by young children. These books also contain many illustrations
in outline. The ruling is very simple.</p>

<p>&para; Instruction is afforded showing how the pupil should sit at
the desk, and hold the pen and paper. A series of drill movement
exercises, thirty-three in number, with directions for
their use, accompanies each book.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N these series the best modern methods of instruction have
been combined with those older features which gave the
author&rsquo;s previous arithmetics such marvelous popularity.</p>

<p>&para; Built upon a definite pedagogical plan, these books teach
the processes of arithmetic in such a way as to develop the
reasoning faculties, and to train the power of rapid, accurate,
and skillful manipulation of numbers. The inductive method
is applied, leading the pupils to discover truths for themselves;
but it is supplemented by model solutions and careful
explanations of each step.</p>

<p>&para; Each new topic is first carefully developed, and then enforced
by sufficient practice to fix it thoroughly in the mind.
The problems, which have been framed with the greatest care,
relate to a wide range of subjects drawn from modern life and
industries. Reviews in various forms are a marked feature.
Usefulness is the keynote.</p>

<p>&para; In the First and Second Books the amount of work that
may be accomplished in a half year is taken as the unit of
classification, and the various subjects are treated topically,
each being preceded by a brief r&eacute;sum&eacute; of the concepts
already acquired. In the Third Book the purely topical
method is used in order to give the pupil a coherent
knowledge of each subject. The Complete Book covers
the work usually given to pupils during the last four years
of school.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS series presents a new method of teaching language
which is in marked contrast with the antiquated systems
in vogue a generation ago. The books meet modern
conditions in every respect, and teach the child how to express
his thoughts in language rather than furnish an undue
amount of grammar and rules.</p>

<p>&para; From the start the attempt has been made to base the work
on subjects in which the child is genuinely interested. Lessons
in writing language are employed simultaneously with those in
conversation, while picture-study, the study of literary selections,
and letter-writing are presented at frequent intervals.
The lessons are of a proper length, well arranged, and well
graded. The books mark out the daily work for the teacher
in a clearly defined manner by telling him what to do, and
when to do it. Many unique mechanical devices, <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, a
labor-saving method of correcting papers, a graphic system of
diagramming, etc., form a valuable feature of the work.</p>

<p>&para; These books are unlike any other series now on the
market. They do not shoot over the heads of the pupils,
nor do they show a marked effort in writing down to
the supposed level of young minds. They do not contain
too much technical grammar, nor are they filled with what
is sentimental and meaningless. No exaggerated attention is
given to analyzing by diagramming, and to exceptions to ordinary
rules, which have proved so unsatisfactory.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the new series of these sterling geographies emphasis is laid
on industrial, commercial, and political geography, with just
enough physiography to bring out the causal relations.</p>

<p>&para; The text is clear, simple, interesting, and explicit. The
pictures are distinguished for their aptness and perfect illustrative
character. Two sets of maps are provided, one for
reference, and the other for study, the latter having corresponding
maps drawn to the same scale.</p>

<p>&para; The INTRODUCTORY GEOGRAPHY develops the
subject in accordance with the child&rsquo;s comprehension, each
lesson paving the way for the next. In the treatment of the
United States the physiographic, historical, political, industrial,
and commercial conditions are taken up in their respective
order, the chief industries and the localities devoted largely to
each receiving more than usual consideration. The country
is regarded as being divided into five industrial sections.</p>

<p>&para; In the SCHOOL GEOGRAPHY a special feature is
the presentation of the basal principles of physical and general
geography in simple, untechnical language, arranged in numbered
paragraphs. In subsequent pages constant reference is
made to these principles, but in each case accompanied by
the paragraph number. This greatly simplifies the work,
and makes it possible to take up the formal study of these
introductory lessons after the remainder of the book has been
completed. With a view to enriching the course, numerous
specific references are given to selected geographical reading.</p>

<p><span class="dropcap">O</span>VERTON&rsquo;S APPLIED PHYSIOLOGIES form a
series of text-books for primary, grammar, and high
schools, which departs radically from the old-time
methods pursued in the teaching of physiology. These books
combine the latest results of study and research in biological,
medical, and chemical science with the best methods of
teaching.</p>

<p>&para; The fundamental principle throughout this series is the
study of the cells where the essential functions of the body
are carried on. Consequently, the study of anatomy and
physiology is here made the study of the cells from the most
elementary structure in organic life to their highest and most
complex form in the human body.</p>

<p>&para; This treatment of the cell principle, and its development
in its relation to life, the employment of laboratory methods,
the numerous original and effective illustrations, the clearness of
the author&rsquo;s style, the wealth of new physiological facts, and the
logical arrangement and gradation of the subject-matter, give
these books a strength and individuality peculiarly their own.</p>

<p>&para; The effects of alcohol and other stimulants and narcotics
are treated in each book sensibly, and with sufficient fullness.
But while this important form of intemperance is singled out,
it is borne in mind that the breaking of any of nature&rsquo;s laws
is also a form of intemperance, and that the whole study of
applied physiology is to encourage a more healthful and a
more self-denying mode of life.</p>

<p>&para; In the preparation of this series the needs of the various
school grades have been fully considered. Each book is well
suited to the pupils for whom it is designed.</p>
